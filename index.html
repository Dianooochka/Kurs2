              Hi! I am Bill Gates, an American entrepreneur and philanthropist. I am the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation and one of the richest people in the world.

              <h2>About me, my education and my career</h2>
              <p>
                I was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. My parents were William H. Gates Sr. and Mary Maxwell Gates. My father was an attorney and my mother served on charitable boards.<br><br>
    
                Growing up, I was interested in technology and coding from a young age. I wrote my first computer program at age 13 and founded my first company, Traf-O-Data, at age 16. After graduating from Lakeside School, I went on to attend Harvard University, but dropped out after two years to start Microsoft with my childhood friend, Paul Allen.<br><br>
    
                Microsoft became one of the world's largest and most successful software companies, revolutionizing the personal computer industry with our Windows operating system and Microsoft Office suite of productivity software. In addition to my work at Microsoft, I have also been heavily involved in philanthropy through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on improving global healthcare and reducing poverty.<br><br>
    
                Throughout my career, I have been recognized for my contributions to the technology industry and philanthropy, receiving numerous honors and awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Today, I remain active in both technology and philanthropy, working to advance the field of artificial intelligence and to make the world a better place through innovative solutions to global problems.
